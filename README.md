NRMproject01.py constains the main program cocernin black-box identification of a one-day-ahead forecast model regarding the inflow to the Chatelot reservoir, at the border between Swiss and France. Autoregressive, exogenous autoregressive, artificial neural networks and classification and regression trees are considered.

NRMproject02.py contains different alternatives regarding the construction of a dam, and an evolutionary-based optimization algorithm based on Direct Policy Search. The goal is to optimise a control strategy with respect to multiple conflicting objectives (by simulating different stakeholders' interests) starting from a standard operating policy consisting of a piecewise linear function.
The optimization procedure could be considered as a kind of Evolutionary Mult-Objective Direct Policy Search (EMODPS), however no particular already-existing algorithm is used, rather I preferred to build a simple version from scratch myself.
