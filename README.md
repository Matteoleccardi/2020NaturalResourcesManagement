NRMproject01.py constains the main program cocernin black-box identification of a one-day-ahead forecast model regarding the inflow to the Chatelot reservoir, at the border between Swiss and France.

NRMproject02.py contains different alternatives regarding the construction of a dam, and an evolutionary-based optimization algorithm based on Direct Policy Search. The goal is to optimise a control strategy with respect to multiple conflicting objectives (by simulating different stakeholders' interests) starting from a standard operating policy consisting of a piecewise linear function.
The optimization procedure could be entitles as Evolutionary Mult-Objective Direct Policy Search (EMODPS), however no particular existing algorithm was used, rather I preferred to build a simple version from scratch.
